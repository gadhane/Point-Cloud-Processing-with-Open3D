## Overview

Point clouds represent 3D shapes or objects through a collection of data points in space. Processing these point clouds is crucial in fields like computer vision, robotics, and 3D modeling. This repository provides practical examples and code snippets to help you get started with point cloud processing using Open3D.

## Projects

### 1. Point Cloud Visualization

Visualize point cloud data using Open3D's powerful rendering tools.

- **Features:**
  - Load various point cloud formats (e.g., PLY, PCX, XYZ)
  - Interactive 3D visualization with customizable settings
  - Color mapping and rendering options

### 2. Point Cloud Filtering

Clean and preprocess point cloud data through filtering techniques.

- **Features:**
  - Downsampling with voxel grids
  - Noise removal using statistical outlier detection
  - Smoothing and denoising algorithms

### 3. Registration and Alignment

Align multiple point clouds into a single coherent model.

- **Features:**
  - Global registration with RANSAC-based methods
  - Fine-tuning alignment using Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
  - Transformation estimation and application

### 4. Surface Reconstruction

Reconstruct surfaces from point cloud data to create 3D meshes.

- **Features:**
  - Poisson surface reconstruction
  - Alpha shapes and ball-pivoting algorithms
  - Mesh optimization and texturing

### 5. Clustering and Segmentation

Divide point clouds into meaningful segments or clusters.

- **Features:**
  - Euclidean distance-based clustering
  - Plane and object segmentation using RANSAC
  - Density-based clustering (DBSCAN)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/point-cloud-processing-with-open3d.git
   cd point-cloud-processing-with-open3d
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that Open3D is included in your `requirements.txt`.*

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory you're interested in and run the corresponding Python scripts. For example:

```bash
cd projects/1_point_cloud_visualization
python visualize.py --input ../../data/sample.ply
```

*Replace `sample.ply` with your point cloud file if needed.*
